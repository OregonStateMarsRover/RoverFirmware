CURRENT BUGS:
System untested.  Can write code to the XMega, but the communication to the Sabertooth doesn't work.

TO BE TESTED:
Communcation over RS485
Communication to Sabertooth
Ring buffer (It's a circular queue)
Optical encooder ( position )
Magnetic encoder ( speed )
PID


TO BE IMPLEMENTED:
Current measurement
Limit switches and indexing
Fault detection


EXPLANATION:
I'm too lazy to use the bug tracking integrated into Github, so this 
is what I do instead for small projects.
This file is tracked along with the rest of the repository.  So, as 
we find bugs and fix bugs, we make note of that in this file.
