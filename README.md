About this repository
---------------------

This repository holds embedded code for the 2013 Oregon State University Robotics Club Mars Rover (University Rover Challenge).
The main person working on it is currently Marshal Horn ( kamocat@gmail.com ), though you may also want to talk to Ben Narin or John Zeller.

This robot is capable of hurting itself and you.  That means this code is safety-critical.
So, if you are testing code, branch off to work on it.  Don't merge with Master until you KNOW it works.
