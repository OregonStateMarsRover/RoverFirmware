# This file tells git what not to commit, so we can be lazy
# and say "git add ." instead of specifying each file.

# Compiled files:
*.o
*.out
*.hex
*.map
*.lst


# Editor files
*.swp


# We will name symbolic links to datasheets with .link extensions
# but we want these to be ignored, since they will be different on
# different systems.
*.link
